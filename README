_Numerical_Analysis:_Theory_and_Experiments_ is a textbook on numerical
analysis. Numerical methods are designed and implemented, and then they are
analyzed through a combination of mathematical theory and numerical
experimentation. Problem areas include interpolation, integration, linear
systems, zero finding, and differential equations. Chebyshev methods are
used early and often.

This package is a library of numerical routines that accompany the book.



MATLAB versus Octave
--------------------

The original package at

https://github.com/briansutton/nate

contains MATLAB codes. This is a port to Octave.



Installation
------------

The library is installed as follows:

1. Download the package nate-octave.tar.gz.

2. Start Octave.

3. Install the package:

   octave> pkg install nate-octave.tar.gz

   The full pathname must be provided if nate-octave.tar.gz is not located in
   the current working directory.

4. Load the package:

   octave> pkg load nate-octave

5. Verify that the library routines are available as follows:

   octave> nate
   Numerical Analysis: Theory and Experiments

6. Set numeric format to long:

   octave> format long g

Steps 4-6 must be repeated each time Octave is restarted.



Demonstration
-------------

The following code computes and plots the arctan function.

>> g = @(x) 1/(1+x^2); a = 0; b = 10;
>> fa = 0;
>> qs = samplecheb(g,[a b],60);
>> ps = antiderivcheb(fa,qs,[a b]);
>> p = interpcheb(ps,[a b]);
>> newfig;
>> plotfun(p,[a b],'displayname','p');
>> ylim([0 pi/2]);
>> legend('location','southeast');
